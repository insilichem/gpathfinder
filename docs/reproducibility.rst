.. _reproducibility:

===============
Reproducibility
===============

One of the key aspects of every research project is its reproducibility. Sometimes, specially when using softwares in their early lifecycle, provide enough information to reproduce calculations could be hard due to high amount of changes in the default values.

When reporting results obtained by a GPathFinder calculation, you should provide the following information:

- The full `.yaml` file, for example, in the supporting information.
- The version of the program you have used (for example, v.1.0.1). This will allow to deduce the values for the parameters that are not explicitly reported in the `.yaml` file.

The information of the default parameters for each version is provided in :ref:`parameters` section.
